== Description ==

Thanks for checking out the [localendar](http://www.localendar.com) calendar plugin for WordPress. We have been powering web calendars for thousands of sites for over 13 years, and are pleased to provide a dedicated calendar plugin for WordPress.

Why use a slow, stripped-down calendar plugin that offers only a few basic features when you can have the power of our complete solution which offers [over 100 features](http://www.localendar.com/calendar/online-calendar-features)?

**We always display full event titles!** Many calendar plugins truncate your event titles to fit their layout, and force users to mouse-over each entry to see the full text. 

localendar makes it easy to customize the calendar on your site. Whether you use our Theme Editor (no coding required!) or custom CSS hooks, you can make your calendar fit your site perfectly.

Now with **Twitter integration**: Send event reminders as custom tweets.

= Calendar Features =

* Full event title display on all calendar views - **no trunctation!**
* Month/Week/Day block and list views, "Today + Happening Soon", and a mini-calendar widget
* Twitter and email support for event reminders 
* Sophisticated "Repeating Event" Functionality
* Publish your calendar and events in various languages and timezones
* Full import/export support for iCal-based calendars (Google, Yahoo, Apple, etc)
* Merge calendars
* **Unlimited** custom event categories
* Local **weather forecasts**

* Extensive clipart library, or upload your own. 
* 8 different [transition effects](http://www.localendar.com/samples/specialeffect1/free-web-calendar.html) that can be applied to your public calendar when visitors move to a different time period: Fade, Vertical Slide and Fade, Zoom In, Bounce Right, Curtain, and more!
* **Powerful WYSIWYG Theme Editor:** Our custom point-and-click widget gives you amazing control over the look and feel of your calendar. No CSS or development skills required!
* Custom Image Backgrounds: Upload your own images to make your calendar seamlessly fit your site
* Common Event Information: Add "boilerplate" text (such as 'About Us', contact info, location, etc) to all of your events automatically without tedious retyping.
