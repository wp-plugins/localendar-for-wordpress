== Description ==

Why use a slow, stripped-down calendar plugin that offers only a few basic features when you can have the power of a free localendar calendar on your site? Localendar offers [over 100 features](http://www.localendar.com/calendar/online-calendar-features) that provide a complete calendar solution.. Here are just a few:
* Go beyond the traditional Month/Week/Day formats by selecting from our 9 different calendar layout styles (including our mini calendar with pop-up event balloons)
* Sophisticated "Repeating Event" Functionality
* Publish calendars in various languages and time zones
* Integrated RSS and iCal feeds
* Merge calendars
* Custom event categories
* Local weather forecasts
* Common Event Information: Add "boilerplate" text (such as 'About Us', contact info, etc) to all of your events automatically without tedious retyping.
* Use Images and Clipart in Event Descriptions: Add multiple images and clipart items to your events to create highly visual and detailed descriptions
* Extensive clipart library, or upload your own. 
* 8 different "transition" effects that can be applied to your public calendar when visitors move to a different time period: Fade, Vertical Slide and Fade, Zoom In, Bounce Right, Curtain, and more!
* Powerful WYSIWYG Theme Editor: Our custom point-and-click widget gives you amazing control over the look and feel of your calendar. No CSS or development skills required!
