== Description ==

Thanks for checking out the [localendar](http://www.localendar.com) calendar plugin for WordPress. We have been powering web calendars for thousands of sites for over 12 years, and are pleased to provide a dedicated WordPress plugin.

Why use a slow, stripped-down calendar plugin that offers only a few basic features when you can have the power of our complete solution which offers [over 100 features](http://www.localendar.com/calendar/online-calendar-features)?

**We always display full event titles!** Many calendar plugins truncate your event titles to fit their layout, and force users to mouse-over each entry to see the full text. 

localendar makes it easy to customize the calendar on your site. Whether you use our Theme Editor (no coding required!) or custom CSS hooks, you can make your calendar fit your site perfectly.

Now with **Twitter integration**: Send event reminders as custom tweets.
